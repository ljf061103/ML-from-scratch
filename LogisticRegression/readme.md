You should have some basics. It is recommended to first watch the logistic regression part of Andrew Ng's machine learning course.
Some of the code here needs to be combined with the contents in the LinearRegression folder because they were originally part of a single package; I just separated them. I might upload all of them, so there's no need to worry too much.
你应该有所基础，建议先观看吴恩达机器学习的逻辑回归部分。
这里面有部分代码需要结合LinearRegression文件夹内的内容，应为他们本是一个包，只是我把它们分开了，我有可能会都上传，所以不必过度担心。
